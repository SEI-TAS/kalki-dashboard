## Prerequisites
< In this section, discuss any prerequisites which will need to be filled for the code to run.
For example, OS, environment settings, and network access are all valid prerequisites. If the
system does not have any requirements that you know of, just write `Not applicable.`. >

## Configuration
< This section should be a walkthrough of the initial setup of a system. If this is documented
somewhere public (i.e. public github wiki) you can link to it, otherwise you should specify it
in its entirety here. >

## Usage
< This section is for how to use the system once it is setup. You may want to detail how to
restart the system, run it locally, or run it remotely. >

## < Anything else >
< From here on, the README is not structured. Additional sections can include specific
configuration settings, licensing, or authors. >
